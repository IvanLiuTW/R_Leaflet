# Visualization of Parking lots and Spots info

I used R and Leaflet package to visualize the government's open data.

Users can easily check the parking lots info by selecting different district in Taichung.

Scroll the map to show more or less spots info.

If you have any ideas, I'm all ears. ðŸ˜ƒ
